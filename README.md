# GettingDataCoursera
Project, Completed.

The included script combines both the test and training data into one datatable.

After this, the data for mean and standard deviation were subsetted, and the variable names cleaned up.

Finally, it is split into groups by activityname and subjectid, and the final tidy data is written to a text file.

If you want to read in the final tidy data, simply:
    finaltidytable <- read.table("finaltidydata")

For all other information, look in the file titled "markdown.md". That's where the codebook and explanation of data is.
